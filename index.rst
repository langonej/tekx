            <h2>Need Support?</h2>
            <p>Please reach out to your team's Nutanix mentor.</p>
            
Getting Started
===============

.. note::

  Welcome to our inaugural hackathon!  In an effort to help deliver the maximum hackathon experience we have made some of our internal training available to each of you.  
  
The content in the left is some of the content we used to train our own technical staff here at Nutanix.  We are providing it here as an idea of what's possible, and as a guide to someone who may be new to some of this technology.

**However, since we are preparing our infrastructure for the hackathon, the content provided is for educational purposes only.** 
  
The Challenges
===============
As this is our first ever .Next Hackathon our goal is to ensure we provide maximum fun and also an environment of maximum creativity.  Your team will be asked to build a solution during the allotted window on Tuesday May 8th.  We kindly ask that you do not pre-build your solutions ahead of time.  Research, tinkering with new platforms, iterating your ideas, however, is absolutely encouraged!

Your team's submission will be evaluated by a panel of judges and the winner will be announced during a special time slot during the main .Next Conference!

Your team's submission must adhere to *one of the categories below*.

*LIVE*

Showcase how interacting with the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS can be woven into one's everyday life.

CHALLENGE
In this challenge, we are looking for new ways to manage or interface with Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS! Push our APIs and integrate it with everyday platforms such as Alexa, home automation platforms, or external APIs. Ideas include deploying new workloads with Google Home or failing over your environment from your smart watch.

*WORK*

Showcase how the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS can make the workday easier.

CHALLENGE
In this challenge, we want to see who can create the most elegant answer to automate application-either one of your own choosing or one of the many Nutanix partner workloads! Ideas include automating the setup of remote site when it powers up and deploying the required network services or creating a super-health check that combines NCC, a DR recovery check and even a DB integrity check? What task will you automate?

*PLAY*

Showcase an entertaining solution for next-generation IT that utilizes the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS.

CHALLENGE
Creativity is king! How can we integrate bleeding-edge IT into Nutanix? Take a stateful application and turn it into a distributed Kubernetes pod or create a blockchain-based budgeting method to deploy or share resources or even use sizing insights to convert a VM to a Kubernetes container running on Google Cloud Platform. We want to see your creativity!
 
Logistics
===============
  
The Hackathon will start prompty at 08:00am on Tuesday May 8th, 2018.  Main .Next Conference registration will begin at 0700 on Tuesday.  Please head to registration and you will be guided to the special area for the Hackathon.

Hackathon Breakfast will start at 0730.

*Beginning on Wednesday May 2nd*, 2018, each team will have full access to their own cluster.  Details on how to connect, credentials, and other useful info, will be posted directly to this site.  Please keep in mind that the clusters will be reset the night before the event to ensure everyone starts from a level playing field.

The Nutanix IT Team will also be onsite for minimal support and assistance.

Judging
===============
  
<info to come>

The winning team will be announced Wednesday morning during the opening keynote.

The Hacking Environment
===============
This hackathon will utilize hosted Nutanix clusters.  Connectivity will likely be provided through a virtual desktop session with dedicated bandwidth.

*What does this mean?*

This means that there will be no direct network access to the cluster.  You will be developing your solution in the hosted environment.

*Suggested Things to Consider*

Nutanix Calm for building blue prints may be a powerful tool in the solution.  Your team will be free to build and deploy containers and VMs so external solutions could be built and deployed (eg Node-RED, MagicMirror).
